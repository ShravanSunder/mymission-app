### React & State Management
- Will be using rxjs with observable-hooks in conjunction with either (Redux or recoil).  See
  -   [React hooks + rxjs](https://thomasburlesonia.medium.com/https-medium-com-thomasburlesonia-react-hooks-rxjs-facades-4e116330bbe1)

  -   [observable-hooks](https://observable-hooks.js.org/guide/)
-   Thinking about using recoil instead of redux (+redux-toolkit) for state management
  -    still to be decided
